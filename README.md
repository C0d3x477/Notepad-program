# Notepad-program
I have a bug in this program but it is not showing up in Eclipse

 This is a notepad program I was challenged by my friend to create. U wanted to add a feature that allowed users to input commands. This has a calculator command which allows users to input two numbers and depending on the operation they want, they can type in sum, quotient, product difference, or remainder.
 
 After You type in the two numbers, the code compiles fine until you type in the operation.
 
 I extended the CalculatorCMD to NamerecallCMD.
 
 Help
 
The bug is located in line 13 of the NamerecallCMD class and in line 42 of my main Notepad class
